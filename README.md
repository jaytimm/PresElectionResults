A simple and transparently constructed/aggregated collection of American
political data, including federal election returns and Twitter details
about American lawmakers.

Election returns:

-   for congressional races for both chambers (from 1976 onward) made
    available via [MEDSL](). We have ever so slightly massaged these
    data for …. House results by congressional districts; Senate returns
    by state.

-   Presidential returns by congressional district for 2008, 2012, and
    2016 elections via [The DailyKos]().

-   Presidential returns by state for elections since 1864 scraped from
    Wikipedia.

With the least … , we have made uniform … within and across data sets.
